        "If we consider that the main driver of a low value for $p(B|A, I)$ is the number of false positives, the only means by which a probability of .99 can be achieved is by greatly reducing the probability of a false positive. Such a small portion of the population actually has tuberculosis, so the majority of positive tests come from false positives (hence the low probability of actually having the condition given a positive test). Raising the accuracy of detecting a positive case will actually have a minimal impact in comparison.<br>\n",
        "To demonstrate the minimal impact of positive test accuracy, if we left the value at 0.8, the allowable Type 1 error would be\n",
        "$p(A| \\neg B, I)$ which equals:<br>$((p(A|B,I)p(B|I)/.99)-(p(A|B,I)p(B|I))/p(\\neg B|I)$=.00003245 or **0.0032%**\n",

        "So in any event, much effort will have to go into reducing the false positives almost to non-existence. Therefore, if I were in charge, I would not invest any energy in the positive test accuracy unless it could be easily achieved, and focus on eradicating the possibility of false positives.\n",
